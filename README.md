# Kotlin OOP Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my Kotlin code for practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each module or directory in the repository may focus on different aspects of OOP, demonstrating how to implement classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and other fundamental OOP principles.

## Structure
The repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific OOP concept or a set of related concepts. Here's a brief overview:

- `inheritance`: Examples related to class inheritance.
- `encapsulation`: Demonstrations of encapsulation principles.
- `polymorphism`: Illustrations of polymorphic behavior.
- ...

Feel free to navigate into each directory for more details on specific concepts.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have Kotlin installed on your machine to run or modify the code. You can download it from [official Kotlin website](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html).

### Running the Code
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kotlin-oops.git

# Navigate to the specific directory
cd kotlin-oops/inheritance

# Compile and run the Kotlin file
kotlinc YourFile.kt -include-runtime -d YourFile.jar
java -jar YourFile.jar
